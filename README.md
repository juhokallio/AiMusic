The original idea was to create music, more specifically canons in the style of Bach. Canon is a strict form of classical music, and creating one is as much about solving chess like search tree problem as having sophisticated music taste. To me this made it an interesting problem, since computer has here some definite advantages over humans. I managed to create building blocks for the canon generator, and something else as a side product. The system works almost like a game where the players teach the machine to compose classical music.

Some of the created music samples can be listened in https://soundcloud.com/user-508904177.
